# Numpy-Tutorial
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

* A powerful N-dimensional array object

* Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions

* Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code

* Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.
## Installation Instructions

It is highly recommended you install Python using the Anaconda distribution to make sure all underlying dependencies (such as Linear Algebra libraries) all sync up with the use of a conda install. If you have Anaconda, install NumPy by going to your terminal or command prompt and typing:
    
    conda install numpy
    
**If you do not have Anaconda and can not install it, please refer to [Numpy's official documentation on various installation instructions.](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/user/install.html)**
### Using NumPy
Once you've installed NumPy you can import it as a library:<br>
- __import numpy as np__
